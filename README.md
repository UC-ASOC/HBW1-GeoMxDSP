# Hands-on Bioinformatics Workshop (HBW), Series I
ASOC (Applied Spatial Omics Centre) is hosting a **Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis Workshop** focusing on **Nanostring GeoMx DSP** data analysis and visualization to profile the whole transcriptome at the University of Calgary.

## Workshop Information 
The workshop will include lectures and hands-on tutorials to cover data (pre)processing, normalization, and visualization of the Nanostring GeoMx DSP data. Nanostring offers a set of R packages that enables comprehensive QC/analysis of the GeoMx DSP data and the following two vignettes will be covered in the Workshop. In addition, Nanostring generously provided the Spatial Organ Atlas and the Human Brain dataset will be used to generate results. The goal is to provide **comprehensive analysis schemes** for Spatial Transcriptomics data analysis, specifically Nanostring GeoMx DSP data, and other bioinformatic tasks.

## About Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP)
GeoMx DSP is the most flexible and robust spatial multi-omic platform for the analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh frozen (FF) tissue sections. GeoMx is the only spatial biology platform that non-destructively profiles the expression of RNA and protein from distinct tissue compartments and cell populations with an automated and scalable workflow that integrates with standard histology staining. It uses fluorescent imaging reagents to visualize tissue and oligo-tagged reagents for expression analysis. After selecting regions of interest (ROI), DNA oligos are released, and collected in a 96-well plate. Expressions levels are readout using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) or nCounter and analyzed using the DSP interactive software.
